This is my submission for Coursera's JHU Data Science on
Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

This repository contains:
1.) 'tidy.txt' as the tidy data set which is the main output of the analysis
2) 'run_analysis.R' contains the script for performing the assigned tasks in the analysis 
3) 'code_book.md' describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed in 'run_analysis.R' to clean up the data. 
4.) 'README.md' briefly explains the files inside the repository

The data collected are from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from this website: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. I am tasked to perform these tasks in 'run_analysis.R':

1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
